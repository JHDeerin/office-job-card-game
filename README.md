> WARNING: This game is very much in-development and not balanced, tested, complete, or ready to hold down a job on its own yet. I also wrote a frighteningly large percent of the initial draft after midnight (on a weekday). Tread with care.

Office Job is a completely realistic simulation of life in the corporate world via the medium of card games. Your goal is to climb the corporate ladder, have a successful career, and become the most successfulest employee person in your company. It will take hard work, determination, and skill - or a bit of cheating!

Throughout the game, you'll accumulate "career points" as you play cards representing various actions, events, and skills. 

There are 3 corporate "ranks" in Office Job:

-   **Rank 1: Entry-Level Employee** - Everyone starts at this level. Nothing special.
-   **Rank 2: Manager** - Reached when you have 5 career points. Once per turn (at any point during your turn), you can choose a lower-ranked player and "delegate" them to play a card from your hand (i.e. you play a card from your hand, pick the target, etc., but the effects happen as if the chosen player had played the card instead - if it says "gain career points" the chosen player gains those career points, etc.). This does not count as playing your own card for the turn (you do this in addition to playing your own card).
-   **Rank 3: C-Suite** - Reached when you have 10 career points *and* you've played an active "C-Suite Skill" card. In addition to the manager skill, you may also once per turn choose to *either* gain 1 career point for free or give -2 career points to a lower-ranked player.

You win the game by having the highest rank out of all the players. If there's a tie in rank (e.g. 2 C-Suite players), break the tie by who has the most career points. If there's still a tie, you share the victory!

## Setup

Shuffle the deck of 100 cards. Deal 15 cards to each player, then put the remaining cards face-down in the center. This will be the "central pile" shared by all players.

Each player should shuffle their 15 cards, then place them facedown as their own personal deck; each should then draw 5 cards from their personal deck for their starting hand.

The player with the most corporate experience/most interesting work horror story/winner of the inevitable pre-game trial-by-combat brawl goes first.

### Play

On each player's turn, they draw 1 card from their personal deck; if they don't like that card, they may discard it and replace it with a draw from the central deck.

They then pick 1 card from their hand and play that card, taking whatever effect it says (you *must* play a card if you have at least 1 card in your hand). The card will stay face-up in play for them until the start of their next turn, at which point the player will discard it, then draw a new card - *unless* the card specifically says it has a longer effect (e.g. "until the end of your next turn"). In that case, the card stays in play until its effect runs out, then is discarded.

> "C-Suite Skill" cards are special, and remain in play for the rest of the game after a player plays them

Managers/C-suites may use their abilities at any point throughout their own turn.

When a player draws the last card from their personal deck, at the end of that turn, they must discard the rest of the cards from their hand. Their "turns" technically may continue (e.g. they may use their manager/C-Suite abilities), but they likely will not be able to play any cards.

The game ends at the *end* of the turn when the last player runs out of cards in their personal deck. At that point, scoring begins and is counted with the ranks/career points of each player at that moment, *including card effects that temporarily changed a player's rank.*

### Random Rules

-   A player cannot drop below the Entry-Level Employee rank, or go above the C-Suite rank
-   A player can never have less than 0 career points, or less than 0 cards in their hand/deck
-   A player is promoted to the next rank *immediately* whenever they meet the criteria for that rank, even if it's another player's turn (unless there's a card in effect that prevents this). If a player ever stops meeting the qualifications for a rank, they drop back down immediately (again, unless a card effect prevents this)
-   If you draw a C-Suite Skill card but already have a C-Suite skill in play, you *must* place it face-down on top of the central deck; do not draw another card to replace it (but you may still play a card from your hand that turn)
-   If the central deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile and use that as the new central deck
-   If a card's condition can't be fulfilled, skip that condition (but its effect must be carried out if possible)
